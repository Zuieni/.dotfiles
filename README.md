## What?

A setup based on my current likings.
Current setup:

* Fedora
* Gnome
* Neovim
* [zsh](https://thevaluable.dev/zsh-install-configure/)

## A gentle warning

If you actually find anything useful, you should not use the 'install.sh' script because it would probably mess up your current config files.
